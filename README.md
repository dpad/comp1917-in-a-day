# COMP1917 In A Day

[COMP1917 In A Day](http://comp1917.dpadilha.com) is an educational website designed to teach the basics of programming in C.

It was specifically created to cater for [University of New South Wales (UNSW Australia)](http://www.unsw.edu.au) students taking the first-year computer science course, [COMP1917 - Computing 1](https://wiki.cse.unsw.edu.au/info/COMP1917).

The aims of this project were simple:
* To explain aspects of programming in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) (the programming language taught in COMP1917).
* To teach in a manner that is easy-to-understand.
* To stroke our own egos by building a custom templating engine in PHP (a terrible, terrible mistake).

## Disclaimers

**This is an unoffical, unendorsed, unmaintained guide** to the COMP1917 course. This guide was written by former students based on their own experiences of the course, and may thus become increasingly irrelevant over the course of time. Everything in this guide should be taken as **advice only**. When in doubt, **consult your tutor and/or lecturer**.

To provide a bit of history, the majority of the actually useful content of this guide was originally written by [Stephen Sherratt](https://github.com/stevebob). The less-useful bits, including the website itself, the horrible custom templating engine (before stuff like Jekyll was cool), and any silly or inappropriate flavour text were mostly done by [Dan Padilha](https://github.com/dpad). So you know who to blame.

## Contributing changes

*This project is unmaintained* (or sparsely maintained). You are welcome to provide feedback and/or changes, whether via email or Github, just as we are welcome to completely ignore it and continue about our extremely busy and overwhelmingly successful lives (a natural consequence of having effectively lived this guide, of course).

For future reference, the website is currently hosted at [dpad.github.io/comp1917-in-a-day](https://dpad.github.io/comp1917-in-a-day/). As the original templating engine is built in PHP and we're too lazy to upgrade it, a static snapshot of the website is currently built via a recursive `wget` and committed directly to the `gh-pages` branch. Please forgive us for this great sin, our exalted Lord of Programming, Linus.
